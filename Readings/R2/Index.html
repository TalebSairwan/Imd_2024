    <div class="title">Reading Response 2: What Screens Want</div>
    <div class="response1"> 1) Frank Chimero's central thesis in "What Screens Want" revolves around exploring the
        evolving nature of designing digital screens. He delves into the metaphorical connection between the reduction
        in size and strength of aspirin pills and the transformation of computers into sleek screens. Chimero highlights
        the importance of understanding screens as a unique interaction and interface design material. The concept of
        "flux," representing the capacity for change in screen design, becomes a critical element of his thesis. He
        argues that designing for screens involves managing change and encourages the adoption of a language of
        transformation in the design community. The article ultimately calls for reevaluating current web abstractions
        and a new vision for technology and the web, emphasizing values like extensibility, openness, and community.

    <div class="response2">2) In the debate between flat design and skeuo, I lean towards a balanced approach
        incorporating elements from both principles. Flat design offers simplicity, clarity, and a modern aesthetic,
        which can enhance user experience by reducing visual clutter. On the other hand, skeuo elements provide users
        with familiar visual cues, making interfaces more intuitive, especially for those less familiar with digital
        interactions. The ideal design approach lies in recognizing the context and purpose of the application. A skeuo
        design might enhance usability for specific applications, especially those with complex functionalities or
        catering to a diverse user base. In contrast, flat design principles can offer a clean and contemporary user
        experience for minimalist and content-focused interfaces. However, the effectiveness of a design approach
        depends on factors such as the target audience, the application's function, and the overall user experience
        goals.

    <div class="response3">3)A zoopraxiscope was an early device used for displaying moving pictures and creating the
        illusion of motion through a sequence of still photographs. In web and interaction design, the zoopraxiscope is
        a historical precursor to the animation and motion graphics commonly employed in modern digital interfaces. The
        zoopraxiscope's projection of sequential images laid the foundation for using animation in web design. The
        device's ability to convey motion through a series of images parallels how animated GIFs or other short, looping
        animations are used on the web today. This historical connection underscores the idea that the development of
        screens and animation is intertwined, shaping the current landscape of web and interaction design.
