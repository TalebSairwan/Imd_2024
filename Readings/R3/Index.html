    <div class="response1"> 1) Laurel Schwulst supports individual websites over social media primarily because of their
        level of control and personalization. She highlights the importance of owning one's digital presence and
        crafting it as a reflection of oneself rather than being confined to the limitations and algorithms of social
        media platforms. Individual websites allow for creative expression, flexibility in design, and the ability to
        curate content without external interference. Additionally, Schwulst highlights the potential longevity of
        websites compared to the temporary nature of social media posts, which can easily get lost in the endless stream
        of updates. I agree with Schwulst because individual websites provide a space for authentic self-representation
        and deeper audience engagement. They empower individuals to shape their online identities on their terms,
        fostering meaningful connections and maintaining digital artifacts in a way that social media platforms often
        cannot.

    <div class="response2">2) Imagine a website as a garden, where each page is like a different section of the garden,
        offering unique experiences and information to visitors. Just as a garden requires careful planning,
        cultivation, and maintenance, a website demands thoughtful design, organization, and upkeep. The homepage serves
        as the entrance, welcoming visitors and guiding them through pathways to various sections, such as articles,
        projects, and contact information. Navigation menus act as signposts, directing visitors to different garden
        parts. Visual elements like colors, fonts, and images contribute to the atmosphere, setting the tone for the
        visitor's journey. Just as a well-tended garden attracts attention and fosters a sense of peace, a well-designed
        website captivates users and encourages exploration.
