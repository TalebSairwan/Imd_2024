                    When I was looking for a topic to do I liked the "What comes after the environment" So for the
                    colours I was thinking to go for green and yellow to represent the environment, and for the text i
                    was looking for more a funky text less edges to make it more catchy for the eye.

                <p>
                    In figma I wanted to implent my designs so I started off with a light green colour and a dark green
                    colour then i wanted to see of a border would work out in the page layout I centerd my main title to
                    see how it would look like, but i felt like it was too formal more like a blog than a poster.

                <p>
                    I wanted to go for a less formal and pixel perfect format so i decided to move the text to left side
                    of the screen and make the colour of the page all light and tried to make the text the darker green
                    with some texted highlighted in yellow to show the important information in the text.

                <p>
                    In the final draft I changed everything I made the background lighter and more on the yellow side,
                    then I made The text white so it pops up more and I highlighted the important text in yellow and
                    grey, i added a banner up top highlighting the information about the event location time date. I
                    added some interactive animation at the end. i made the text about the authors apear on scroll and
                    Underline when you hover over it. i made the main text jump in when you fiest load the page and
                    swing when you hover over it.
