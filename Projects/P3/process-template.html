                    After researching how drag-and-drop features are used on websites, I noticed that these elements are
                    everywhere, but we often don't realize it. Common examples include dragging files into a dropbox or
                    selecting text by clicking and dragging across it. Inspired by this, I decided to create an
                    interaction based on balls with a gravity effect. These balls will vary in size, bounce around, and
                    eventually come to a stop. This concept aims to blend simplicity with interactive fun, making the
                    web experience more engaging without overcomplicating it.

                <p>
                    After dedicating considerable effort to integrating gravity effects into the balls, I realized the
                    interaction still felt lacking. To enhance the user experience, I introduced a feature where
                    double-tapping the screen spawns balls at random locations. Additionally, I implemented a collision
                    effect: when the balls collide, they merge into a single, giant ball. This added layer of
                    interactivity enriches the engagement and introduces unexpected dynamics and visual interest to the
                    interaction.
